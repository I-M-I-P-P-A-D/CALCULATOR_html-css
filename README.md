# CALCULATOR_html-css
This is a Calculator that I created using Html and css. This is just a layout for the calculator aka UI
Here is a Preview of it.
Just keep it in mind that it's not responsive ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜… So you have to do it your self

Just Updated it!!! It's functional now!!
it's not a scientific calculator though but you can to the basic calculations from it.
peaceðŸ¤ž
